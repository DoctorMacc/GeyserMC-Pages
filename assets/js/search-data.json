Requires that you have Floodgate installed and the auth-type set to floodgate. userAuths: A section where you can put the authentication information for your Minecraft: Java Edition account for immediate login when joining Geyser. It is advised you ONLY use this option if you are running Geyser locally and that ONLY you have access to the config as it requires you put your Minecraft: Java Edition credentials in plain text! . If your Xbox account name was Notch, your Java email was foobar2000@gmail.com and your password was hunter2, you would fill this into the config: . userAuths: Notch: # MCPE/Xbox username email: foobar2000@gmail.com password: \"hunter2\" . command-suggestions: Bedrock clients freeze or crash when opening up the command prompt for the first time with a large amount of command suggestions. This config option disables command suggestions being sent to prevent any freezing. passthrough-motd: If the MOTD should be relayed from the remote server. Causes the motd1 and motd2 options in the bedrock section to no longer have a use. passthrough-players: If the current and max player counts should be relayed from the remote server. legacy-ping-passthrough: If enabled, manually pings the server by impersonating a Minecraft client instead of using the server’s API. This option should only be enabled if your MOTD or player count is not accurate, as it can cause errors especially on BungeeCord. This option does nothing on standalone. ping-passthrough-interval: How often the fake Minecraft client should attempt to ping the remote server to update information, in seconds (a setting of 1 will ping the server every second; a setting of 3 will ping the server every three seconds). Only relevant for standalone and legacy ping passthrough. Increase the number if you’re getting timeout or BrokenPipe exceptions. max-players: The maximum amount of players that can join through Geyser. debug-mode: If debug messages should be printed in console. Useful if you run into an error and need more context. general-thread-pool: The amount of threads Geyser will be able to use. Higher is not always better :P. allow-third-party-capes: If third party (Optifine, 5zig, LabyMod, etc.) capes should be displayed to the bedrock player. allow-third-party-ears: If third party Deadmau5-style ears should be enabled. Currently only supports MinecraftCapes. default-locale: The default locale to send to players if their locale could not be found. Check this page https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/FAQ#what-languages-does-geyser-support to find the code corresponding to your language. chunk-caching: Cache chunks for each Bedrock player and adds support for additional sounds at the expense of more RAM usage. This option is always on for Bukkit as we can use the server’s API to get block information at no expense. above-nether-bedrock-building: Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether - enabling this config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID to the End ID. The main downside to this is that the sky will resemble that of the End sky in the Nether, but ultimately it’s the only way for this feature to work.

Most commonly, it’s because they do not open up ports over the UDP protocol, which is what Minecraft: Bedrock Edition uses, opposed to Minecraft: Java Edition using TCP.

Afterward, open up your FTP file manager and find the Nukkit jar. Then, replace this jar with the server software you’re using. Upon starting up the server, it should open up ports over UDP whilst still allowing you to use the server jar you desire. PLEASE NOTE: If your server automatically redownloads jars upon startup, such as with an autoupdate system, this workaround will not work.
